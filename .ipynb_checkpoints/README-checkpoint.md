# VBA Scripting

## Background

VBA scripts written to summarize the annual change in stocks and highlight stocks with the greatest increase and decrease in a given year.  Adjustments made across the entire VBA script allowing it to run on every worksheet.

## Stock Market Analysis

1. VBA scripts developed to loop through all the stocks to generate the following information:

* The ticker symbols.
* Yearly change of opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* Percentage change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting set to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

2. Additional scripts developed to return the stock with the "Greatest %Iincrease", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Total Volume".
